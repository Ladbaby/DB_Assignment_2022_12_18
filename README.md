# DB Assignment: Music Database

If you're willing to run the project, please follow the following steps.

## Front end dependencies setup
```
npm install
```

## Compiles and minifies for production (front end)
```
npm run build
```

## Back end dependencies setup

Please follow the instructions from Django to install it.

## Run the project

### Start the server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

If you encounter the problem of port already in use, try a different port using the following command. For instance, run the server on port 9000 instead:

```
python manage.py runserver 9000
```

### Access the corresponding localhost port

You can access the UI using browser

For example, by default, the program runs at port `8000`, so the browser needs to access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
